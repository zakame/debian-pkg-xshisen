Installing Shisen-sho for X11

1. You need

   [1] OSF/Motif 1.2 or above, or Athena widget set
   [2] Xpm library
   [3] C++ compiler like gcc

   You can find Xpm library, for example, at

   ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/libraries/xpm-3.4k.tar.gz

2. Execute "./configure".  The configure has the following
   options.  You need only --with-motif (if you want) normally.
   In case of you want to specify the particular C++ compiler, you 
   can set CXX environment variable before you run configure.

   --with-motif   Use Motif widgets.
   --with-motif-include=DIR
                  Specifies where Motif include file is.
   --with-motif-lib=DIR
                  Specifies where libXm is.
   --with-xpm-include=DIR
                  Specifies where X11/xpm.h is.
   --with-xpm-lib=DIR
                  Specifies where libXpm is.
   --enable-dupscore
                  Allow one person to register multiple scores.
                  At default, only one score for one person can be 
                  registered.
   --prefix=DIR   Specifies the directory to install files.
                  (/usr/local is default)
   --datadir=DIR  Change the directory where pixmap files are
                  installed.  These files will be installed
                  under the DIR/xshisen directory.
   --sharedstatedir=DIR
                  Change the directory where score file is
                  installed.  The DIR/xshisen.scores will be
                  writable to anybody who plays this game.

   If you want to share the same score file with sisenw (Windows
   version of Shisen-sho), you should add the following resource
   into XShisen.ad.ad in order to specify the score file path of
   sisenw.

     XShisen*scoreFile: /dos/c/sisenw/sisen.log

3. make install  (If you have old xshisen-scores in your xshisen
   data directory, this does not install the dummy score file.)

4. make install.man
